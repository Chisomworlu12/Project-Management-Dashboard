**Developer:** Chisom Worlu
**AI Tool:** Gemini & Claude

Technical Collaboration Notes:

- **UI/CSS Troubleshooting:** I built the table layout but ran into issues with the scroll functionality. I used the AI to identify that max-height does not apply directly to <table> elements.

- **Code Auditing:** I developed the core logic for the dashboard, including the data mapping and component structure. I used AI to audit the code for potential bugs, specifically catching a variable mismatch between the filtering hook and the search input.

- **Mock Data Generation:** I used Claude AI to generate the mockProjects.json dataset. This allowed me to quickly create a robust set of 10+ projects with diverse statuses and long string values to properly stress-test the UI layout without manual data entry.
